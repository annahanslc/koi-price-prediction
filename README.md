# Koi Fish Classification

Raising koi fish is a growing hobby in the United States, driven by increasing demand for ornamental pets and the rising popularity of backyard ponds and garden landscaping. The aesthetic appeal and calming presence of koi ponds are drawing more homeowners to purchase their first koi.

In contrast, across the world in Japan, koi keeping is more than a visual hobby--it carries deep cultural significance. Breeding, raising, and trading koi is a refined art form that has evolved over centuries. Many of the most sought-after koi in the U.S. are still those imported from Japan or bred from prestigious Japanese lineages.

For a first-time buyer, whether online or at a local store, the wide variety of patterns, colors, and markings can be overwhelming. Even more surprising is the price tag. While juvenile koi can cost as little as $10, champion-grade koi can sell for tens of thousands of dollars.

Koi fish prices range from $10 for a 5” juvenile to over $50,000 for champion level quality.[(1)](https://www.kodamakoifarm.com/how-much-do-koi-fish-cost/)
The most expensive koi fish ever sold was a Kohaku named "S Legend", which fetched a staggering $1.8 million in 2018. [(2)](https://www.businessinsider.com/koi-fish-worth-millions-expensive-japan-2018-12)

# Project Goal

The goal of this project is to assist koi hobbyists in identifying koi fish varieties, sub-varieties, and traits. Since these visual and genetic distinctions significantly influence a koi’s market value, the tool aims to empower buyers and sellers to better understand what a fish is worth. May they be making their first purchase or selling a fish that they had raised.
